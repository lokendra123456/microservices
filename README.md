Spring Microservices :- Example of a microservice architecture using Spring Cloud

Overview The architecture is composed by four services:

discovery-service: Service Discovery Server created with Eureka
api-gateway: API Gateway created with Zuul that uses the discovery-service to send the requests to the services. It uses Ribbon as Load Balancer
huntgroup-service: Simple REST service created with Spring Boot to use as an example
autoattendent-service: Simple REST service created with Spring Boot to use as an example The services: api-gateway, article-service and author-service are already configured with Hystrix (latency and fault tolerance library) and are providing a stream that you can use to monitor with a Hystrix/Turbine dashboard. You can check the Hystrix Stream accessing the service URL with /hystrix.stream (example: http://localhost:8080/hystrix.stream)
How to use To test this architecture you will need to have: JDK 8+, Docker and Maven installed

Clone this repo and enter it 
Run the start.sh script, it will use Maven to build the .jar file for each service and then use Docker to build the containers with the .jar files  In the default configuration you will have:
Discovery Service running on port 8083, access http://localhost:8083 to see the dashboard
API Gateway running on port 8080, you will send the requests to this service
Two Article Services running on ports: 8081 
Two Author Services running on ports: 8082
